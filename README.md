TwitchPlaysPokemon-FightFor~~Democracy~~Anarchy
====================================

In a land ravaged by the constant battle between anarchy and democracy, you must learn how to fight for <del>democracy and the American way</del> freedom from ledges!

A simple greasemonkey script using very basic jQuery. It is intended to be mostly harmless, but votes for democracy at least half the time. It also has the ability to hide votes of all but selected users (eg friends you know have a twitch account) so you can see something other than just "a", "b", "start", and "YOU GUYS STOP VOTING FOR [fill in the blank]".

It's not very sophisticated right now, it was something I wrote last night to so I could feel like I was part of the game while being responsible and actually doing homework.

Repurpose as needed, but please only put to good use.
